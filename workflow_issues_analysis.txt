CRITICAL ISSUE: Memory Leak Cascade Leading to OOM Failures Before Sampling Step
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
The pipeline reports "memory optimized" while consuming 33.4GB VRAM, leading to 
cascading OOM failures in every VAE encoding operation. The root cause is that 
ComfyUI's model offloading doesn't actually free memory, causing models to remain 
resident in GPU throughout the entire pipeline.

================================================================================
                           WORKFLOW PHASE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

PHASE 1: MODEL LOADING & STRATEGIC PLACEMENT (BROKEN)
----------------------------------------------------
CURRENT FLOW:
1. Load UNET + VAE → GPU (33.4GB consumed)
2. Load CLIP → GPU (additional memory)
3. "Strategic placement" → Models stay in GPU
4. Report: "Memory optimized: UNET + VAE (ComfyUI managed), CLIP (manual)"

ISSUES:
❌ Models loaded to GPU but never properly offloaded
❌ 33.4GB VRAM consumed before any processing begins
❌ "Strategic placement" actually means "keep everything in GPU"
❌ No memory budget consideration or verification

REQUIRED FIX:
1. Load UNET + VAE → GPU temporarily
2. Apply LoRA → GPU
3. Offload UNET + VAE → CPU immediately
4. Keep only CLIP in GPU for text encoding
5. VERIFY: Memory actually freed (should be <1GB)

PHASE 2: LoRA APPLICATION (BROKEN)
----------------------------------
CURRENT FLOW:
1. Apply LoRA → GPU
2. "Offload UNET to CPU (not needed for text encoding)"
3. Report: "Memory optimized: CLIP in GPU (manual), UNET/VAE in CPU (ComfyUI managed)"

ISSUES:
❌ LoRA application keeps models in GPU
❌ `unload_all_models()` call doesn't work
❌ 33.4GB still consumed after "offloading"
❌ False reporting of memory optimization

REQUIRED FIX:
1. Apply LoRA → GPU
2. Force UNET + VAE to CPU with explicit .to('cpu')
3. Verify memory actually freed
4. VERIFY: Memory <5GB after offloading

PHASE 3: TEXT ENCODING (WORKING)
--------------------------------
CURRENT FLOW:
1. Encode text → GPU (CLIP in GPU)
2. Offload CLIP → CPU
3. Report: "Memory optimized: All models in CPU, ready for VAE encoding"

STATUS: ✅ This phase actually works correctly
MEMORY: Should be <1GB after CLIP offloading

PHASE 4: MODEL SAMPLING SD3 (BROKEN)
-------------------------------------
CURRENT FLOW:
1. Load UNET → GPU for patching
2. Apply ModelSamplingSD3
3. "Offload patched UNET to CPU (not needed for VAE encoding)"
4. Report: "Memory optimized: All models in CPU, maximum VRAM for VAE encoding"

ISSUES:
❌ UNET loaded to GPU for patching
❌ Never actually offloaded after patching
❌ Memory still consumed
❌ False reporting of CPU placement

REQUIRED FIX:
1. Load UNET → GPU for patching
2. Apply ModelSamplingSD3
3. Force UNET to CPU with explicit .to('cpu')
4. Verify memory freed
5. VERIFY: Memory <2GB before VAE encoding

PHASE 5: VAE ENCODING (CRITICALLY BROKEN)
-----------------------------------------
CURRENT FLOW:
1. "Offload UNET to CPU" → UNET still in GPU
2. VAE encoding tries full frames (832×480)
3. OOM on every single frame
4. Report: "VAE encoding ready with ComfyUI's memory strategy"

ISSUES:
❌ UNET never actually offloaded (still consuming 33.4GB)
❌ VAE encoding processes full spatial dimensions
❌ No spatial tiling during encoding
❌ Every frame fails with OOM
❌ Chunked processing only helps temporally, not spatially

REQUIRED FIX:
1. Force UNET to CPU (verify memory freed)
2. Implement spatial tiling for VAE encoding
3. Process frames in spatial tiles (e.g., 256×256)
4. VERIFY: Memory <5GB during VAE encoding

PHASE 6: UNET SAMPLING (WORKING)
--------------------------------
CURRENT FLOW:
1. Load UNET → GPU for sampling
2. Run KSampler
3. Report: "UNET sampling complete, ComfyUI managing memory"

STATUS: ✅ This phase works because UNET is finally loaded to GPU
MEMORY: Expected to be high (15-20GB) during sampling

PHASE 7: VAE DECODING (BROKEN)
-------------------------------
CURRENT FLOW:
1. "Offload UNET to CPU" → UNET stays in GPU
2. Try tiled decoding → Fails due to tensor dimension mismatch
3. Report: "Memory optimized: VAE follows ComfyUI strategy, UNET/CLIP in CPU"

ISSUES:
❌ UNET offloading still doesn't work
❌ Tiled decoding has tensor shape errors
❌ Memory management ineffective

================================================================================
                           CRITICAL WORKFLOW FIXES
================================================================================

FIX 1: MODEL MEMORY MANAGEMENT
------------------------------
REQUIRED PATTERN:
Phase 1: Load → Apply LoRA → Offload to CPU
Phase 4: Load → Patch → Offload to CPU  
Phase 6: Load → Sample → Offload to CPU

EACH PHASE MUST:
- End with models in CPU
- Start with sufficient VRAM
- Have no overlapping model residency

FIX 2: VAE ENCODING SPATIAL TILING
----------------------------------
CURRENT: Process full 832×480 frames → OOM
REQUIRED: Process 256×256 tiles → Memory efficient

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Split each frame into spatial tiles
- Process tiles individually
- Reconstruct frame from tiles
- Handle tile boundaries and overlap

FIX 3: MEMORY VERIFICATION
--------------------------
AFTER EACH "OFFLOAD":
- Verify memory actually freed
- Check PyTorch allocated vs reserved
- Confirm models are on CPU

BEFORE EACH "LOAD":
- Check available VRAM
- Ensure sufficient memory for operation
- Verify no conflicting models in GPU

FIX 4: PHASE TRANSITIONS
------------------------
EACH PHASE TRANSITION MUST:
- Free all GPU memory from previous phase
- Load only required models for current phase
- Verify memory state before proceeding
- Report actual memory usage, not expected

================================================================================
                           TESTING & VERIFICATION
================================================================================

3. Verify tile sizes are reasonable (256×256 or smaller)
4. Confirm no full-frame processing

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Frames processed in spatial tiles
- Tile sizes <512×512
- No attempts to process full 832×480 frames
- Memory usage stays low during encoding

FAILURE INDICATORS:
- Full frames being processed
- Tile sizes >512×512
- High memory usage during encoding
- OOM errors on individual frames

TEST 5: MEMORY REPORTING ACCURACY
---------------------------------
DESCRIPTION: Verify memory reports match actual usage

TEST STEPS:

2. Check pipeline memory reports
3. Compare reported vs actual values
4. Verify consistency

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Reported memory matches actual usage
- No false "memory optimized" claims
- Accurate memory state reporting

FAILURE INDICATORS:
- Reported memory doesn't match actual
- False optimization claims
- Inconsistent memory reporting

================================================================================
                           IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY
================================================================================

PRIORITY 1 (CRITICAL):
- Fix model offloading to actually free memory
- Implement VAE encoding spatial tiling
- Add memory verification after each operation

PRIORITY 2 (HIGH):
- Fix phase transition memory cleanup
- Implement proper memory state reporting
- Add memory budget enforcement

PRIORITY 3 (MEDIUM):
- Optimize tile sizes for different resolutions
- Add memory usage monitoring
- Implement progressive fallback strategies

================================================================================
                           SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

THE PIPELINE IS FIXED WHEN:
1. ✅ Model offloading actually frees GPU memory
2. ✅ VAE encoding uses spatial tiling (no full-frame processing)
3. ✅ Each phase starts with clean memory state
4. ✅ Memory reports match actual usage
5. ✅ No OOM errors during VAE encoding
6. ✅ Pipeline completes successfully to video output

CURRENT STATUS: ❌ ALL CRITERIA FAILED
- Models stay in GPU after "offloading"
- VAE encoding processes full frames
- Memory accumulates across phases
- False memory optimization reports
- OOM on every VAE operation
- Pipeline fails before sampling step

================================================================================
                           CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The current pipeline has fundamental memory management flaws that prevent it from 
functioning. The "memory optimization" claims are false - the pipeline actually 
consumes 33.4GB VRAM and never frees it, leading to cascading OOM failures.

FIXES REQUIRED:
1. Implement actual model offloading (not just reporting)
2. Add VAE encoding spatial tiling
3. Fix phase transition memory cleanup
4. Add memory verification and reporting

Without these fixes, the pipeline will continue to fail with OOM errors before 
reaching the sampling step, regardless of chunking or other optimization attempts.
